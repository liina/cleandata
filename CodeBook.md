Unpack the zip file into subidrectory of working directory UCI HAR Dataset.

2.test/X_test.txt and train/X_train.txt were merged into a dataset of 561 variables and 10299 observations

3.Only variables for standard deviation and average values were extracted -  leaving 79 variables.
Extraction was based on features.txt file - only features containing std or mean were considered.
It was assumed that number of row in features.txt was the same as column index of the X_test.txt and X_train.txt files.

4.Additional columns were added to the dataset:
Activity - activity names and Subject - code for individual testers

5.Data was grouped by Subject and Activity and mean value for each group was found for each variable

The resulting dataset contains 180 observations - 6 activities for 30 individuals and 79 variables:
